# Introduction

While {{ book.variables }} work in normal pages, they don't work in SUMMARY.md or GLOSSARY.md â˜¹

Glossary entries won't resolve correctly, if one glossary entry is equal to the first word of another entry.
Example: GitBook con't distinguish between car and car chase given the current [glossary](GLOSSARY.md).
